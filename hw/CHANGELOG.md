# v0

Very first circuit I created. Low frequency (2MHz), has a few problems
(black stripes between the wide "pixels")..

Note that the R and B channels are swapped around compared to what I
actually built (and thus what I wrote scripts for), as it's equivalent
and makes the schematic a lot easier to draw.
